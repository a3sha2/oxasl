Python library for ASL analysis using the FSLPY wrapper library for FSL

Plans/ideas
-----------

 - Do we need the IgnorableOptionGroup, OptionCategory gubbins? 

 - Does cblip/cref belong in calibration - should be corrections?

 - Should independently register calib/cblip/cref to ASL - they may be in different spaces

 - Workspace to automatically create AslImage object
