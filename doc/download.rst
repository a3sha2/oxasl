Obtaining the OXASL software
============================

Currently we recommend downloading a pre-built bundle package from our GitHub release page:

A recent version of FSL is required. *In addition* updated versions of various FSL tools
including FABBER are required. These are included in the bundle.

https://github.com/ibme-qubic/oxasl/releases

In the next release of FSL, the need for updated versions of Fabber should be removed and
it should be possible to install the pure python code directly. We hope to make this available
through the FSL Conda repository, and PyPi.
